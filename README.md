# Dota-hero-classification
Using a shallow neural network for linear regression in order to predict the Dota match outcome based on hero choices.

The notebook shows how to pre-process a match dataset found on kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/c/dota-2-prediction/data?select=train.csv) and feed it into a neural network build with Keras.
Due to the complexity of the problem, the network only reaches a 60% accuracy on the problem.

Future prospects of the project include using the open dota api to build a bigger dataset which includes all heroes.
